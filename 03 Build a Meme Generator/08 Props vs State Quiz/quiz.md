  1. How would you describe the concept of "state"?
  A way for React to remember saved values from within a component.
  This is similar to declaring variables from within a component,
  with a few added bonuses (which we'll get to later)


  2. When would you want to use props instead of state?
  Anytime you want to pass data into a component so that
  component can determine what will get displayed on the
  screen.


  3. When would you want to use state instead of props?
  Anytime you want a component to maintain some values from
